For "production-and-support-ready" focusing would be on ensuring the below:
Things to Improve Before Production Deployment:

**1.Thread safety of account transfers**:This can be achieved using synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, or leveraging atomic classes (e.g., AtomicReference) for account state management.
Example: Use a ReentrantLock to ensure no deadlocks or race conditions occur when transferring funds between accounts.

**Proper exception handling and logging for maintainability.**:Exception handling in the code is basic (e.g., DuplicateAccountIdException is caught).
 exception handling and logging (e.g., invalid transfer amount, insufficient funds). It would be beneficial to return appropriate HTTP status codes for each exception (e.g., 400 for bad request, 404 for account not found, 500 for internal errors).
Example: Use @ControllerAdvice to handle global exceptions and provide meaningful error responses.

**Data persistence and scalability for reliability.**:The application uses an in-memory ConcurrentHashMap for account storage, which is fine for testing but not scalable for production.
Migrate to a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to ensure data durability and reliability.

**Security to protect sensitive data and operations.** :Use Spring Security to enforce user authentication and role-based access control for sensitive operations (like transferring funds).

**Transaction management to ensure atomicity of transfers.** :Use @Transactional annotation in the service layer to ensure that the transfer operation is atomic and handled correctly in case of failure.

**API Documentation ** :Adding documentation for the REST API using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI. This makes it easier for us to understand and consume the API.
Health Checks and Monitoring:

**Performance & Load Testing**:Using tools like JMeter to simulate concurrent requests and test how the application performs under load.
